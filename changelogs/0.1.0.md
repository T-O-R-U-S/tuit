# Changelog for 0.1.0

# TODO: Complete changelog.

## BIG refactoring

A lot of the modules have been shifted and moved around to ease maintaining the project.

Many of the moved around code has been re-exported in the areas where it made sense to
reduce breakage.

The biggest changes you should look out are that some traits have been moved into further
subdirectories, especially the `Extended` (formerly `TerminalExtended`) trait.

It is now found in `tuit::terminal::extended::Extended`. It is also in
the `tuit::prelude`.

## Traits changed. Like, loads. Loads of changes. Big ones. Big changes. 🔥

The `Terminal` trait has been broken off into like... a buncha traits yo
🔥🚒🚒🧯👩‍🚒👨‍🚒.

### The `Terminal` trait has been broken off into:

- `Metadata`: These are methods that return basic info about the terminal. I decided to
  break it off into its own trait because otherwise, it would be repeated
  across `TerminalConst` and `TerminalMut`.
- `TerminalConst`: Methods that do not require mutable access to the terminal.
  This is auto-implemented for all references and pointers to `TerminalConst`s.
- `TerminalMut`: Methods that do require mutable access to the terminal. This is
  auto-implemented for all mutable references and pointers to `TerminalMut`s.

There has also been a new marker trait added, `Terminal`, introduced that is
auto-implemented for anything implements these 3 traits.

### The `Widget` trait has been updated accordingly

The `Widget::update` method now takes in a `TerminalConst` because you should not be
drawing to the terminal during an update.

### The `Style` trait, and the `Colour` struct have been moved into a new `style` subdirectory.

It just made sense to break them off into their own thang 🤑🤑💸

### The `Target` trait got changed to `Renderer` to avoid confusion when not qualifying with `draw::Target`.

This should help stop confusing people 🥇🥇🥇

Also makes sense. I mean... the `Renderer` trait has `render`, right?

### The `BoundingBox` trait and the `Rectangle` type.

The `BoundingBox` trait now exists — this means that widgets may have child widgets now and use the `Rectangle`'s 
dimensions and coordinates to be able to work around them.

### `Terminal::view` and `Terminal::view_mut` methods

Allows you to get a subsection of a `Terminal` and treat it as if it were a full `Terminal`.
Invaluable if you want to take a widget and then draw it in a specific area.

### `terminal::ViewSplit` allows you to create horizontal and vertical splits of your terminal.

Read the docsssss if you want this fire 🔥🔥🔥

### Certified 240 FPS on a bad benchmark

The benchmark is like... wack yo... but its certified 240 FPS yo...

### `Margin` widget allows you to add padding to your widgets.

Your widget needs to implement proper `BoundingBox` support to make use of `Margin`
